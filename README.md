# Movie_Prediction_System_Using_ML
This project involves building a movie prediction system that recommends movies based on textual similarity of movie descriptions. It converts the movie descriptions into numerical vectors using the Bag of Words model and then calculates the cosine similarity between them to measure their semantic closeness.
